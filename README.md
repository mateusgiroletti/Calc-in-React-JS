# Calc In ReactJs

This is one of my first reactjs projects, a simple calc, where I watched some classes from the channel [Cod3er](https://www.youtube.com/@cod3r). It was important to know some basic concepts of the ReactJs.

## Interfaces

The project contains only one screen, the calculator itself.
